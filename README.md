### Healthcare Predictive Analysis in Oncology: Skin Cancer

#### Introduction

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a healthcare predictive model for skin cancer diagnosis using deep learning techniques. The project aims to improve the precision and efficiency of skin cancer diagnosis by leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

#### Project Overview

Skin cancer, with its numerous types and high morbidity rate, remains a significant public health issue. Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily visual inspections and dermoscopic investigations, are often subjective and time-consuming. Our study introduces an automated, non-invasive approach to early skin cancer detection using deep learning models trained on the HAM10000 dataset.

#### Dataset

The HAM10000 dataset is utilized in this project, comprising over 10,000 dermatoscopic images categorized into various diagnostic types. The dataset is publicly available and widely used for training and evaluating models in medical image analysis.

#### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Addressing missing values using KNN imputation
   - Normalizing data and reducing dimensions
   - Resizing images to a uniform size of 125x125 pixels

2. **Image Processing**
   - Color normalization using histogram equalization and color constancy algorithms
   - Data augmentation techniques including rotations, shifts, flips, and brightness/contrast adjustments

3. **Model Training**
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
   - One Versus All (OVA) model to handle multi-class classification

4. **Evaluation**
   - Model accuracy and performance comparison with other models
   - Analysis of class imbalances and their impact on model performance
   - Recommendations for future improvements using pre-trained models like ImageNet and advanced architectures such as VGGNet, ResNet, or DenseNet

#### Results and Future Scope

The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 73%, which, although promising, indicates room for improvement. The One Versus All (OVA) strategy showed better performance for handling class imbalances. Future work will focus on:
- Using pre-trained models for better feature extraction
- Addressing data imbalances through advanced preprocessing techniques
- Implementing deeper and more abstract feature extraction methods with models like VGGNet, ResNet, or DenseNet
- Enhancing model precision and interpretability for clinical applications

#### Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in improving skin cancer diagnosis. By incorporating advanced data preprocessing, augmentation techniques, and leveraging sophisticated neural network architectures, we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated skin cancer detection.
